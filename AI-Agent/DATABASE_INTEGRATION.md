# MongoDB Integration - VeriFin

## ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!

### What Was Implemented:

#### 1. **MongoDB Database Module** (`database.py`)
- ✅ Connection to local MongoDB (localhost:27017)
- ✅ Database: `verifin`
- ✅ Three collections: `invoices`, `vendors`, `anomalies`
- ✅ Automatic indexing for fast queries

#### 2. **Collections Schema:**

**Invoices Collection:**
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  filename: String,
  uploadDate: DateTime,
  invoiceNumber: String,
  vendorName: String,
  gstNumber: String,
  allGstNumbers: Array,
  totalAmount: Float,
  invoiceDate: String,
  hsnCodes: Array,
  itemDescriptions: Array,
  quantities: Array,
  ocrConfidence: Float,
  complianceResults: Object,
  mlPrediction: Object,
  rawText: String
}
```

**Vendors Collection:**
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  gstNumber: String (unique),
  vendorName: String,
  totalInvoices: Int,
  totalAmount: Float,
  firstInvoiceDate: DateTime,
  lastInvoiceDate: DateTime
}
```

**Anomalies Collection:**
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  invoiceId: String,
  invoiceNumber: String,
  anomalyType: String,
  severity: String (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW),
  description: String,
  detectedDate: DateTime,
  relatedInvoiceId: String (optional)
}
```

#### 3. **Anomaly Detection (Automatic):**

✅ **DUPLICATE_INVOICE** - Same invoice number uploaded twice
✅ **GST_VENDOR_MISMATCH** - Same GST used by different vendors (FRAUD ALERT!)
✅ **UNUSUAL_AMOUNT** - Amount 3x higher than vendor's average
✅ **HSN_PRICE_DEVIATION** - Same HSN code with 50%+ price difference

#### 4. **New API Endpoints:**

```
GET  /api/invoices/history?limit=50    - Get invoice history
GET  /api/vendors                      - Get all vendors
GET  /api/anomalies?severity=HIGH      - Get detected anomalies
GET  /api/dashboard/stats              - Get dashboard statistics
POST /api/invoices/upload              - Upload & store invoice (enhanced)
```

#### 5. **Automatic Processing Flow:**

```
1. User uploads invoice
   ↓
2. EasyOCR extracts data
   ↓
3. ML anomaly detection
   ↓
4. Compliance checking (12 features)
   ↓
5. **STORE IN MONGODB** ← NEW!
   ↓
6. **DETECT HISTORICAL ANOMALIES** ← NEW!
   ↓
7. Return results with database anomalies
```

## 🎯 What You Can Now Do:

### 1. **Track All Invoices:**
- Every uploaded invoice is stored
- Full history available
- Search by vendor, GST, date

### 2. **Detect Fraud:**
- Same GST + Different Vendor = 🚨 ALERT
- Duplicate invoices = 🚨 ALERT
- Unusual amounts = ⚠️ WARNING

### 3. **Vendor Analytics:**
- Total invoices per vendor
- Total amount per vendor
- Average invoice amount
- First & last invoice dates

### 4. **Anomaly Reports:**
- All detected anomalies
- Filter by severity (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Related invoice references

## 📊 Dashboard Statistics Available:

```javascript
{
  totalInvoices: 0,           // Total invoices processed
  totalVendors: 0,            // Unique vendors
  totalAnomalies: 0,          // Total anomalies detected
  highSeverityAnomalies: 0,   // High-risk anomalies
  totalAmountProcessed: 0     // Total ₹ processed
}
```

---

## 🧪 Test It:

### 1. Upload an invoice:
```
Upload any invoice → It will be stored in MongoDB
```

### 2. Upload same invoice again:
```
🚨 DUPLICATE_INVOICE anomaly detected!
```

### 3. Upload invoice with same GST but different vendor:
```
🚨 GST_VENDOR_MISMATCH anomaly detected!
```

### 4. Check history:
```
GET http://localhost:8000/api/invoices/history
```

### 5. Check anomalies:
```
GET http://localhost:8000/api/anomalies?severity=HIGH
```

## 🔍 MongoDB Compass:

Open MongoDB Compass and connect to `localhost:27017`

You'll see:
- Database: `verifin`
- Collections: `invoices`, `vendors`, `anomalies`
- All uploaded invoices stored there!
